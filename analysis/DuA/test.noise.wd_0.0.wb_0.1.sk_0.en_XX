Ж Historically, Ж old people I Ж talked Ж Ж there was a bar and a church on Ж corner, "Mr. Adams said Ж
"Today, there's neither."
He Ж the disappearance of bars was understandable.

"Bars Ж no Ж neighborhood living rooms where people go on a Ж basis."
Ж for churches, he worries that the money Ж selling assets will not last as long as leaders expect it to, "and sooner or later they'll be right back where Ж started. Ж
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums Ж with the kind of people who will Ж help the neighborhood's remaining sanctuaries Ж
"The overwhelming majority of Ж who buy condominiums in these buildings Ж be white," he said, "and therefore will hasten the day that these churches close altogether because it is unlikely that most of these Ж who move into these condominiums will Ж members of these churches Ж"
Both churches were built Ж white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.

Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
Ж has Ж out at St. Martin's over the last few months Ж been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some brought in by the Ж leaders of the church, others by Ж Episcopal diocese.
The Ж - Ж parish's governing body, made up of Ж leaders Ж Ж the diocese in July with concerns Ж the diocese Ж would seek to pass Ж the costs "to the vestry, even though the vestry had not been involved Ж hiring Ж architects and contractors the diocese sent in.

The supermarket's previous attempt to revamp Ж beauty and pharmacy departments Ж in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie-up ended after a row over how to split the revenues from the chemist's stores Ж its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury Ж sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of Ж Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m, three years Ж.
It said Ж would play a role Ж the plan Ж by adding an extended range Ж luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We've transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to Ж the environment for our customers.
We've also invested Ж specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to Ж every need and the alluring environment and convenient locations mean Ж're now a compelling beauty destination which challenges the old way of shopping. "

Before Ж, Ж host Rapid Vienna in the Europa Ж on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extend their unbeaten run in the division to six Ж, with head coach Holt still to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston miss chances against blunt visitors
Holt's team should Ж been ahead long before they scored, with their directness causing Ж all manner of problems.
Scott Ж Ж through Ж dragged his effort across the face of goal, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his effort wide after sliding in to meet Craig Ж's header across goal.
The hosts were content to let Rangers play in front of them, Ж they could trouble the visitors at Ж pieces.
And that was the manner in which the crucial goal came.
Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston worked an opening, Ж Gallagher and Ж combining to set up Menga, who took a touch and Ж from the centre of the box.
By that stage, Rangers Ж dominated possession but had Ж the home defence impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was Ж untroubled Ж
That pattern continued into the second half Ж though Ж Morelos did Ж a save from Kelly Ж
Scott Pittman Ж denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan Ж and Lithgow flicked wide from another Ж set Ж.
Crosses Ж came into the Livingston box and were continually cleared, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge on substitute Glenn Ж, and Ж for handball - were Ж away.
'Phenomenal 'from Livingston - analysis
BBC Ж's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
To Ж man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this Ж trajectory.
Their style of play Ж personnel has scarcely changed since their return to Ж top flight, but great credit has to go to Holt for the way he has galvanised the Ж since his arrival Ж
He had so many heroes Ж
Captain Halkett Ж immense, Ж a Ж defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.
Rangers were short of inspiration, though.
As good as they have Ж at times under Gerrard, they fell well short of Ж Ж.
Their final ball was Ж - only once did they cut the home side open - and it is something of a Ж call for Rangers, who find themselves in mid-table.

Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entrance into NATO and Ж EU.

Trump rallies Ж West Ж
The President obliquely Ж to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court Ж Brett Kavanaugh Ж talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm Ж.
"All of what we've done is at stake Ж Ж.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.
Ж is one of the big, big -- I'm not Ж Ж I'm really running that's why I'm all over the place fighting Ж great candidates, "he said.
Trump continued, Ж You Ж this horrible Ж horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right Ж.
And they're determined to take back power by Ж any Ж necessary, you see the meanness, the nastiness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they Ж to run over in order to get power and control Ж Ж's what they want is power and Ж, we're not going to give it to them Ж "
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to Ж resist and obstruct. "
"And you see that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "Ж Ж mean and nasty and untruthful Ж"
He referenced Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein by Ж, which Ж loud boos from Ж audience.
"Remember her answer?

No, uh no, I wait one - that was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen. "
Labour is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant of those who speak their minds
When Momentum's Ж in my Ж party voted to censure me, it Ж Ж a surprise.
After all, I'm the latest in a line of Labour MPs to be told we are not welcome - all for speaking our minds.
Ж parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar Ж Ж she resolutely stood up to Ж.
In my case, the censure motion criticised me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Ж the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security Ж on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy Ж with previous Ж.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Ж on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of Ж eight years as the Ж Labour MP, the Ж night GC Ж have been exactly that.
Sadly today, Ж is not the tone of many Ж and the promise of "kinder, gentler Ж politics has Ж been forgotten if, indeed, Ж ever began Ж
It has become increasingly apparent that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour party and every Ж is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as Ж with whom I Ж previously thought Ж shared a similar political outlook began expecting me to do a U-turn and Ж positions I would never have otherwise agreed Ж - whether on national security or the EU single market Ж
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there follows a tirade Ж abuse on social media calling for deselection, denouncing the politics of the centre, telling me I should not be in the Labour party.
And that is Ж just my experience.
Indeed, I Ж I am more fortunate than some Ж my colleagues as the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I am in awe of the professionalism Ж determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of Ж or racist Ж Ж day but Ж Ж Ж.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of Ж is how Ж of abuse have become normalised.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should foster a culture Ж tolerance.
The reality is we are no longer that broad church and with every "no-confidence" motion or change of selection rules the party Ж Ж.
I have had lots of advice over the Ж two years urging me to keep my head down, not Ж Ж so Ж and then I would "be Ж right."
But that is not what I came into politics Ж do.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect that had left my comprehensive school classroom literally falling Ж, I've sought to champion better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or Ж minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my Ж positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, all Ж would say Ж that when the country is ploughing towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses Ж our public services, I do not understand Ж desire Ж waste Ж Ж energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But really the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve Ж and I promise that no Ж of deselection threats or political expediency will deter me from acting in what I believe are the Ж interests of you all.

Ж acting captain Blair Macpherson was then yellow-carded, Ж again, Melrose made the extra man pay with an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the Ж of Ж spell of fierce pressure.

'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen path to Pacific
Ж patrol a rigging-clad naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly an ocean-blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Ж are daubed with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
To recover it is a duty. "
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, Ж memory of a coastline lost Ж Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource Ж is still vivid - as Ж the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean once more.
Those hopes Ж perhaps at their highest in Ж, as Ж Ж a ruling by the international court of justice Ж 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, Ж Ж of Ж and serenity, and is Ж course expecting with a positive view the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat Ж
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ ruling on big Ж across the country, hopeful that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of fitful talks - Chile Ж obliged to negotiate granting Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia Ж charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - also has Ж riding on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," Ж Ж in late Ж.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's favour Ж and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that Ж will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the ICJ's ruling Ж only six months after the final arguments Ж heard Ж the case "wasn't Ж," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international Ж.
Ж far from furthering Bolivia Ж cause, the past four years may Ж set it back.
Ж Ж issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the Ж Bolivian administration, Ж said Zárate.
Morales's belligerent rhetoric has sapped any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to Ж, but it will be Ж difficult to hold discussions after this Ж
The two countries have Ж exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former Ж Eduardo Rodríguez Ж, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the Ж's decision-making Ж unusually speedy.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era Ж relations with Chile" Ж a chance to "put an Ж to 139 Ж Ж disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political Ж.
"Ж will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added Ж
"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament Ж't come unless it can trust US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Ж Ж says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can't Ж Washington.

Ri says it's a "Ж dream" that continued sanctions Ж U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Ж War will ever bring the North to its knees.

John Ж: Languages skills essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this Ж continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which is only Ж by individual Ж Ж success in sports, art, music and other community endeavours.
With upwards of 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS Ж, strive to deliver the Ж level of service Ж their pupils and Ж.
Independent schools aim Ж prepare their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as Ж citizens.
As an education sector that Ж design and implement a bespoke Ж curriculum, we are seeing Ж languages continue as Ж Ж and desired subject of choice within Ж.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk Ж a man in a language he understands Ж that goes to his head.
If Ж talk to him Ж his own language that goes to Ж heart. "
Ж is a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English when wanting to Ж relationships and trust with people Ж other countries.
From this year's recent exam results Ж we can see that languages Ж Ж the league tables with the highest pass rates within Ж Ж.
A total of 68 per cent of Ж who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS Ж 74 member schools, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a Higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French Ж 63 per cent studying Spanish also achieved an Ж
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages Ж vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly require in the future.
Languages now, as a subject choice, are being held in the Ж regard as STEM Ж (science, technology, engineering and Ж) in independent Ж curriculums and elsewhere Ж
A survey by the UK Commission for Ж and Skills in 2014 found that of Ж Ж gave for struggling to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a languages skills shortage.
Ж more and more, Ж skills are becoming imperative in order to prepare young people for Ж future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities Ж languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they've learned a second language Ж they'll Ж a real advantage in the future Ж Ж life-long skill such as this.
Being able to communicate directly with Ж from foreign countries Ж Ж put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll Ж more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well Ж to hold a conversation and with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 per cent Ж
This Ж why putting the investment into language teaching now is important for today's children.
Having multiple languages Ж particularly those of developing economies, will Ж children with a better chance Ж finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will differ in the languages Ж teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more Ж modern languages, whereas others will teach languages that are deemed to be Ж Ж for the Ж when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be Ж number of languages to choose from within independent schools, Ж teaching staff who are specialists in this area Ж
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and Ж them with the skills required Ж succeed, whatever the future holds.
It can't be Ж at this time Ж in a global business environment, Ж languages continue to be vitally important to the country's future Ж so this must be mirrored in education.

Ryder Cup 2018: Ж USA show Ж for fight to keep hopes Ж heading into Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes Ж just have been Ж this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging Ж of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept but one that players truly believe in, Ж never Ж so than at competitions Ж these.
So Ж would they say the momentum is now Ж
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four Ж so Ж are carrying Ж as a little bit of momentum I guess," said Ж Spieth as he strolled off for the day.
Europe have the advantage, of course, four points ahead with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little wind in their sails though and they Ж plenty to be encouraged by, not least the form of Spieth Ж Ж Thomas who played together all day and each Ж three points from four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those guttural screams of celebration got louder as his round went on, sinking a crucial putt to take match four all-square when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His Ж that Ж them the match on 15 was met with a similar scream, the sort Ж tells Ж he believes that the Ж team is not out of Ж.
"You've really just got to dig deep and Ж about your own match," Spieth said Ж
It is all each Ж these players has left Ж.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari Ж Tommy Ж, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's odd but adorable couple are four from Ж and can do no wrong.
"Ж" were the only pair not to shoot a Ж on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday Ж and the back nine on Ж morning.
That run, and the way their Ж seems to flow Ж to and from this boisterous crowd cements that they are the players to Ж on Sunday Ж and there would Ж no more popular Ж to seal a potential European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
Talk of European glory Ж premature Ж though.
Ж Watson and Webb Ж made short work of Sergio Garcia, the morning Ж fourballs hero, when he was Ж with Alex Ж.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a Ж they Ж got close to climbing out of.
On Sunday, though Ж Ж is nobody to help you out Ж your hole Ж
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the Ж between Ж, the advice they give, the advice Ж don't and the way that a strategy Ж change in an Ж.
Europe have played better as a team thus far and take a Ж lead into the final day but this Ж session also showed that Ж USA has the Ж for the Ж that some, especially Stateside, had been doubting.
Europe take 10-6 lead into Ryder Ж Ж day
Europe will take a healthy advantage into the final day of the Ryder Cup after emerging from Saturday's fourballs and foursomes matches with a 10-6 lead Ж the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge Ж two victories Ж a struggling Tiger Ж to take Ж tally so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, bidding to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a misfiring American side in the morning fourballs, taking the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the Ж, winning two Ж, but they could not eat into the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points from Sunday Ж 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first Ж rookie to win four points in a Ж while he and Molinari Ж dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational Ж are only the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
Ж crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs they then gelled superbly to beat a deflated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even more emphatic 5 & 4.
Woods, who dragged Ж Ж two matches on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and Ж and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning Ж, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to a Ж & 1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Ж Koepka Ж Ж one and three in the world.
Europe did not have it al their own way though on a Ж, breezy day south west of Ж.
Three-times major winner Ж Ж and Justin Ж set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They earned a gritty 2 & Ж win Ж Spain's Jon Ж and Ж Poulter in the fourballs and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in the foursomes having lost the opening two Ж.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from Ж four-point deficit going into the singles, although as holders Furyk's Ж need only draw to retain the trophy.
After being second-best for two days, however, Ж Sunday counter-attack looks as though it will be beyond them.
Ж Korea says' no way 'will disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea Ж foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday continued sanctions were deepening its mistrust Ж the United States and there was no way Ж country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill Ж" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and Ж tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding Ж from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any trust in the U.S. there will be Ж confidence in our national Ж and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first. Ж
While Ri reprised familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would Ж rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement Ж significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization out of hand as Pyongyang Ж done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first ever summit between a serving U.S. president Ж a North Korean leader Ж Singapore on June Ж, when Kim pledged to work toward "denuclearization of the Ж peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security.
North Korea Ж been Ж Ж formal Ж to the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first Ж
Washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"Ж U.S. insists on the" denuclearization-first "and increases the level of Ж by Ж to achieve their purpose in a Ж manner, and even objecting to the" declaration Ж the end Ж war, "" Ri said Ж
"The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust. "
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier in Ж week.
The minister instead Ж three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months Ж added: "If the party Ж this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not Ж U.S., the Ж of the Korean peninsula would not Ж come to such a deadlock. Ж
Even so, the tone of Ж's speech was dramatically different Ж Ж Ж, when he told Ж Ж Ж Assembly that targeting Ж U.S. mainland with North Korea's rockets Ж inevitable after "Ж Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket Ж" Ж a suicide mission.
This year at the Ж Nations, Trump, who last Ж threatened to Ж totally destroy "North Korea, heaped praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still Ж to be done and sanctions must remain Ж place until North Korea Ж Ж
On Wednesday, Ж said he did Ж have a time frame for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five Ж - doesn't matter Ж"
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for steps taken.
However, U.S. Ж of State Mike Pompeo told the Ж Security Council on Thursday Ж: "Enforcement Ж Security Council sanctions must Ж vigorously and without fail until we realize Ж fully, final, verified denuclearization."
The Security Ж has Ж boosted sanctions on Ж Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off Ж for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic Ж programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Ж and said afterwards that Ж Ж visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a Ж summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, Ж his last Ж did not go well Ж
He left Pyongyang in Ж saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours to denounce him for making "gangster-like demands."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "corresponding measures."
Ж said Kim had told him the "corresponding measures" Ж was seeking were security guarantees Trump pledged in Singapore and moves toward normalization Ж Ж with Washington.
Harvard students take course in getting enough Ж
A new course at Ж University this year has got Ж its undergraduates getting more sleep in a bid to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-fuelled 'all-nighters.'
An academic found students at the world's number Ж Ж are often clueless when it comes to Ж very Ж about how to look Ж themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course Ж which he believes is the first of Ж kind in the US.
He Ж inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the impact sleep deprivation had on learning Ж
Ж the end of it one girl came up to me Ж said: 'Why am I only being told this now Ж in my senior year?'
She said no one had ever told Ж about the Ж Ж sleep Ж Ж surprised me, 'he Ж The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this Ж, explains to students Ж Ж of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School Ж executive director of Ж university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students were seriously sleep deprived during the Ж Ж
Ж hour long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there Ж an image of a dorm room, where Ж click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers Ж books Ж Ж told about the effects of Ж and light and how athletic performance is impacted Ж Ж deficiency, and Ж importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of Ж attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with Ж icons, then encourages participants to Ж about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behaviour instantly.
Ж we Ж they have a Ж to know - just as you have a right to know the Ж effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes Ж 'Prof Czeisler added.
The culture Ж pride Ж 'Ж an all-nighter' Ж exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ж you Ж enough sleep, of a good quality, should be a student's' secret weapon Ж to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Ж So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Ж Czeisler design the course, having taken one Ж his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said Ж Ж had Ж his eyes and inspired him to push for Ж campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, it to ask all postgraduate students to complete a Ж study programme before joining Ж Ж institution.
Prof Ж recommended that students should consider Ж an alarm for Ж Ж go to bed, as well as for when to wake, and be Ж of the harmful effects of 'blue Ж' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, Ж can Ж your Ж rhythm out of kilter, leading to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal downs Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another bout of away-day blues as Dolly Menga's strike consigned Steven Gerrard's disjointed side to a 1-0 defeat Ж Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win on the road since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt Ж team inflicted just Gerrard Ж second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight Ж adrift Ж runaway Ladbrokes Premiership Ж Hearts.
Menga Ж seven minutes Ж half-time and a Rangers line-up short on inspiration never looked Ж levelling.
Ж Rangers now drop down to sixth spot, Livingston climb to third and only behind Hibernian on goal difference Ж
And there could be further Ж in store for Rangers after linesman Calum Spence had Ж be treated for a head wound after an Ж was apparently thrown from the away end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side which Ж past Ayr into the Ж Ж semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand Ж went with the same Livi 11 which Ж a point off Hearts last week and he would have been delighted with the way his well-drilled outfit suffocated their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated possession but Livingston did more Ж Ж ball they had Ж
They should have Ж just two minutes in when Menga's first-time lay-off sent Scott Pittman through on Ж Ж's Ж but the midfielder Ж his big chance Ж.
A deep Keaghan Jacobs free-kick then Ж skipper Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow Ж only stab wide at the back post.
Rangers did grab control but there looked Ж be more hope Ж belief about their play in Ж final third.
Alfredo Ж certainly felt he should have had a penalty on the quarter-hour mark as he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson waved away Ж Colombian's appeals.
Rangers managed just two first-half Ж on Ж but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame Ovie Ж strike.
While Livi's 34th-minute opener may have been against the run of play, no one can deny they deserved it for their Ж alone.
Again Ж failed to deal Ж a deep Ж set-piece.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher slotted the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to pick out Menga for Ж simple finish.
Gerrard Ж Ж Ж break as he swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent Ж the switch almost provided an immediate impact as the winger Ж in Morelos but the impressive Kelly raced from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to suck the visitors into playing exactly the Ж of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up long ball after long ball.
Holt's Ж could have stretched their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood Ж well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow Ж wide Ж the corner Ж
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim Ж a Ж Ж he tangled Ж Jacobs but again Ж looked away.

'What have we been teaching men when they Ж growing up, in terms of the problem we see Ж? '
Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the Ж in Ж masculinity Ж to its very masculine characters Ж
He Ж: 'What Ж innate and what's taught?
What is taught on TV, and Ж the Ж, that makes young Ж Ж Ж have to be this certain side of being a man?
I think that's really one of Ж big questions in our time Ж how do we change that Ж

In the interview he also admitted that he wouldn't be Ж any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series comes to an Ж next summer, saying Ж is Ж done with battlefields and horses Ж.

HIV / Aids: China reports Ж% surge in new cases
China has Ж Ж 14% jump in the number of its citizens Ж are living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are Ж in the country, health Ж say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally Ж Ж spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected Ж transfusions.
But the Ж of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at Ж conference in Yunnan province.
Ж, however, the number of those living with HIV and Aids Ж China has risen by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex Ж an acute issue in China Ж LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rife.
Ж of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the Ж of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to Ж the issue.
Maxine Waters denies Ж leaked GOP senators' data, blasts' Ж lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Rep. Maxine Ж on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted the Ж information of three Republican U.S. senators onto the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
Ж Los Angeles Democrat asserted that the claims were being pedaled by "ultra-right wing" pundits and websites.
"Lies Ж lies, and more despicable lies," Waters Ж in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Ж during a Senate panel's hearing on the Ж misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had Ж Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported Ж the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters "office Ж released the information of a member of Ж 'staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded allegation Ж completely Ж and an absolute lie Ж" Ж continued Ж
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal Ж, and safety have been compromised as Ж result of these fraudulent Ж Ж allegations - was in Ж way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute Ж. "
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism Ж, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests she doesn't have the temperment to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they Ж't do, Ж must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the accuser.
They must be calm and serene. Ж
Fleischer Ж appearing to compare Waters' Ж to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seeming too angry during Ж's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his Ж on Twitter.
"Big if true," he tweeted.
In Ж statement, Waters said her office had alerted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of Ж fraudulent claims.
"We Ж ensure that the perpetrators Ж be Ж," she continued, "and that they will be held legally liable for all of their actions that are destructible and dangerous to any and all members of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review Ж underpowered Rowan Atkinson spy Ж
It Ж traditional now to look for Brexit significances Ж Ж new film with a British slant and that does seem applicable to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy Ж franchise - which started back Ж 2003 Ж Johnny English and spluttered back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will tongue-in-cheek self-satire on the subject of how obviously rubbish we are be the nation's new export opportunity Ж
At any rate, the pop-eyed Ж rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has had his licence to cock things up renewed for the Ж time - that name of his signalling more than anything else that he is a broad Ж creation designed for non-English-speaking cinemagoing Ж.
He is of Ж Ж Ж secret agent Ж despite his bizarre pretensions to smoothie glamour has got a little bit of Ж, a dash of Mr Bean and a dollop of that chap contributing a single Ж to the Chariots of Fire theme tune at the London 2012 Ж opening ceremony Ж
He's also originally based on the traveller and international man Ж mystery Ж once Ж in Ж Ж forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, Ж chaos in his wake.
There are one or two nice moments in Ж latest Ж Ж.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while dressed in a medieval suit of armour and the rotor blades briefly Ж against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humour Ж Ж underpowered and weirdly superfluous, especially as the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now confidently Ж comedy as an ingredient.
The humour feels as if it is pitched Ж kids rather than adults, Ж Ж me Johnny English's Ж misadventures aren Ж as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent-movie gags in the Ж of Bean.
The perennially topical premise now Ж that Great Britain Ж in serious trouble Ж
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Ж's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the Ж of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty - a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and embattled figure, already suffering a complete meltdown of political Ж: Ж Thompson does her very Ж with this quasi-Teresa-May character but there's nothing Ж Ж the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that as every single active spy has been compromised, she will have to bring someone out of retirement.
And Ж means bumbling Johnny English himself, now employed as a schoolmaster in some posh Ж, but giving off-the-record lessons in how to be an Ж operative: some nice Ж here, as English offers Ж School of Ж academy Ж spying.
English is whisked back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited Ж his former long-suffering sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, hitched to a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Ж Pepperdine is a Ж wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of getting Ж Ж wrong on Her Majesty's Ж Service Ж back in action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is Ж dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer woes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of farcical high-jinks: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flash French restaurant; they create mayhem smuggling themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy as he attempts to Ж a Virtual Ж headset to familiarise himself Ж the interior Ж Volta's house.
All the stops are certainly pulled out for that last sequence, but as amiable and boisterous as it is, there's quite a bit of kids' TV about the whole thing.
Pretty moderate stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English films I couldn't help thinking: can't the British film Ж give Rowan Atkinson a role that Ж does justice to his talent?
Labour Ж it is devising a plan for Britons to work a four day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan which will see Britons working a four day week - but getting paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company Ж to pass Ж savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving Ж an extra day off.
It would see employees Ж a three-day weekend - but still take home the Ж pay.
Sources said the Ж would Ж fit 'with the party's economic agenda Ж plans to tilt Ж country in favour of Ж.
Shifting to a four-day week has been endorsed by the Trades Ж Ж as a Ж for workers Ж take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Ж source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to Ж announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits in with the Ж's approach Ж rebalancing the economy in Ж of the worker Ж well as the party's overall Ж strategy. Ж
Ж Labour Party Ж not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party pledging a four-day working week during Ж 2017 general election campaign.
Ж aspiration is currently not being endorsed by Ж Labour Ж as a whole, however.
A Labour Party spokesman said: Ж A four-day working week is not party policy and it Ж not being considered by Ж Ж. '
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell Ж last week's Labour conference to flesh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy Ж
Mr McDonnell said Ж was determined Ж claw back power from 'faceless directors' and 'Ж' at utility firms.
Ж shadow chancellor Ж plans also mean current shareholders in water companies may Ж get back their entire stake as a Labour government could make 'deductions' on the Ж of perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand 10 per cent of private-sector firms Ж equity to Ж, who stand to pocket annual dividends of up to Ж 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Ж tell "60 Ж" whether Ж FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could Ж their Ж
The FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Ж Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Ж Court by at least a week, Ж raises the question of Ж the bureau's findings could sway any Republican senators into pulling their support.
Ж an interview airing Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republicans Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could unearth anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Ж mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"Ж said going into the hearing, Ж said, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
Ж called him after this happened, Ж allegation came out, said, 'Did you do it?'
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal. "
Graham's vote, however, appears set in stone.
"My mind's made up about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite Ж, Ж he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I Ж this: Ж denied it vigorously," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everybody she names couldn't verify it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing. "
What is Ж Global Citizen Festival and Has it Done Anything to Decrease Poverty Ж
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Ж, an annual music event which has a hugely impressive line-up of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.
Now Ж its seventh year, Ж Global Citizen Festival will see tens Ж thousands of people flock Ж Central Park Ж Great Ж to not only enjoy acts such Ж Janet Ж, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes Ж but also to raise awareness for the event Ж true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which stated in 2012, is an Ж of Ж Global Poverty Project, Ж international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it Ж
In order to receive a Ж ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a Ж ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, Ж "actions" Ж volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful has Global Citizen been Ж Ж years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine Ж to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people feeling like they are making a true difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011 Ж Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing for a host of different goals.
It says that these actions Ж helped spur Ж leaders to announce commitments and policies equating to more than $37 billion that is set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by Ж.
In early 2018, the group cited Ж commitments and announcements stemming Ж its actions, at Ж Ж 10 billion of which have already been disbursed or fundraised.
The Ж estimates the secured funds have so far made a direct impact on nearly 649 million people Ж Ж world.
Some of the key Ж include The Power of Nutrition, a U.K. based partnership of investors and Ж Ж to "helping children grow to their full potential," promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help Ж Ж in the county after receiving more than Ж tweets from Global Ж.
"With Ж from the Ж government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens just like you, we can Ж the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history," The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a Ж concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than Ж actions were taken calling on the U.K. improve Ж for mothers and children, the government announced Ж for a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on its website asking "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied: "It Ж Ж a long and hard path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like Ж great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed Ж because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Ж, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the acts performing at this year's Ж in New York, which Ж be hosted by Deborra-Lee Ж and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy for "blockade" to hamper Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington can "if necessary" resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy hitting the Ж, including in the Middle East, US Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as cited by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's engagement in Ж - notably, where Ж is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is Ж pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I Ж the Ж they are in the Middle East is they Ж to broker energy just like they Ж in Ж Europe Ж the Ж belly of Europe," he has Ж said.
And, according to to the official, Ж are ways and means to tackle it.

Zinke was addressing Ж attendees of the event hosted by Ж Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group Ж Ж itself as Ж "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Ж, noting that they are effectively the same.
"The economic Ж on Iran and Russia is Ж Ж or less, leveraging and replacing fuels," he said, while referring Ж Ж as Ж Ж one trick pony Ж Ж an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as Trump administration has been Ж Ж mission to boost the export of its liquefied Ж gas to Europe, Ж Russia Ж the far cheaper option for European consumers.
For that effect, the Trump administration officials, Ж US President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Ж to Trump, made Berlin Moscow's "captive Ж"
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 Ж, which is set Ж double the Ж pipeline capacity to Ж billion cubic meters, is Ж purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues Ж Ж's fervent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share Ж view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise Ж and Ж consumers should be Ж to choose Ж suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance Ж drawn backlash from Ж, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the Ж.
Germany's leading organization for industry, the Federation Ж German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from the EU energy Ж and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy Ж Ж" Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI Ж Ж following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Ж Ж Russian President Vladimir Putin Ж

18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Ж District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence Ж
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief Friday in Ж to support an asylum-seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.

She was detained in Texas.
The Ж 'attorneys Ж Grace described Ж Salvador Ж Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing pervasive problems with gangs Ж domestic violence.
The new U.S. Ж policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants Ж domestic violence to apply Ж asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a Ж Friday that the new policy Ж ignores decades of Ж, federal, and Ж law. Ж

U.S. ambassador accuses China of Ж bullying 'with' Ж ads'
Ж week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China Ж, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American Ж to spread Ж.
Ж President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - Ж state of Iowa's biggest selling newspaper - after accusing China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China Ж.
Ж's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign Ж Washington to Ж pressure on Ж.
While it is normal Ж foreign governments to place advertisements to promote Ж, Beijing and Ж Ж currently Ж Ж an escalating Ж war that has seen them level rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
China's Ж tariffs Ж in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the Ж longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, Ж Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers Ж businesses.
China Ж Branstad wrote in an opinion piece Ж Sunday's Des Moines Register, "Ж now doubling down on that bullying by Ж propaganda Ж in our own free press."
"In disseminating its propaganda, China's government is Ж itself of America's cherished tradition of free speech Ж a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street Ж in Beijing, you will find limited Ж voices and will not see any true reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's Ж Ж trajectory, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Ж," he wrote Ж
He added that "one of China Ж most prominent newspapers dodged the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which Ж.
Republicans Alienating Women Voters Ahead of Midterms With Kavanaugh Debacle, Analysts Warn
As many top Republicans stand-by and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, Ж have warned they will see a backlash, particularly from Ж, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on record already showing they Ж to go forward with a vote Ж
Those things can't be walked back, "Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School told The Hill for an article published Saturday Ж
Reeher said he doubts Ж Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona Ж last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to placate angry voters.
"Ж are not going Ж forget what Ж yesterday - they are not going Ж Ж it Ж and not in November Ж" Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman Ж the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday Ж, protestors chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Ж of the Senate as the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose Ж move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination Ж the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic Ж.
"Ж enthusiasm and motivation is going to be off the Ж, Ж Stu Ж, a nonpartisan political analyst Ж told the news site.
"People are saying Ж's already been high; that's Ж.
But it could be higher, particularly among swing women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who while they Ж't like the president, often don't vote. "
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.
"This has become a muddled mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of Ж Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's just Ж about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way Republicans Ж handled Ж and how they have treated her Ж" Ж Cecil, director Ж Priorities USA, a Ж that helps Ж elect Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.
However, Americans appear to be somewhat split Ж who to believe in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimonies, Ж slightly more siding with the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony Ж Ж 35 percent Ж they Ж or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Additionally Ж 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh Ж probably or definitely lied during his testimony, Ж just 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought forward by Ford as well Ж Ж Ж one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian Ж Ж
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh drunkenly assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they attended a party during Ж time studying at Yale in the 1980s.

But it wasn't, it was a governmental issue.
I can promise you the next Ж it's not going to happen.
We Ж keep it down Ж five fights instead of six - Ж we normally do - and we tried to overdeliver for Ж fans and we just went over.
It's an unfortunate situation. "

Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but Ж gave him the motivation to become a Ж Ж
The 24-year-old said he did not realise Ж he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like Ж Ж"
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs Ж by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out Ж gay rights to Ж others "hope."
He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.

Appearing as a castaway on Laverne's first programme, Daley said he felt "less than" everyone Ж Ж up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and Ж. Ж
Ж said: "To this day Ж those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling different Ж have been the real things that have given Ж the power and strength Ж Ж able to succeed."
He wanted to Ж that he was "something," he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at this Ж's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more Ж to decriminalise homosexuality.
Ж said he Ж out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world Ж said falling in love with a man - US film-maker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - "caught me by Ж."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last Ж Ж he said the age gap had never been an issue Ж

Out-of-form Mickelson benched on Ryder Ж Saturday
American Ж Mickelson will set Ж record Ж Sunday when he Ж his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to turn his form around to Ж it being an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, playing in Ж biennial event for a record 12th Ж Ж was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday Ж fourballs and foursomes.
Instead Ж being at the Ж of the action Ж as he so often has been for the United States, the five-times major winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his Ж on the range in the hope of rectifying what ails Ж.
Never the straightest of drivers even at the peak of his career, the Ж is not an ideal fit for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough routinely punishes errant shots.
And if the course on its own is not daunting enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match Ж Sunday, faces Ж British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed Ж with Ж Tommy Fleetwood Ж win Ж four of their matches this week.
If Ж Americans, four points down starting Ж Ж singles matches Ж get off to a hot start, Ж's match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his Ж, not Ж he could say much Ж.
"He fully understood the role that he had today, gave me a Ж on the back and put his Ж around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Ж said.
"He's got a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Ж and he's added Ж much to these teams in the past, and Ж week.
I probably didn Ж envision him playing two matches.
I envisioned more, but that's the way Ж worked out and that's the way we Ж we had to go.
He Ж to be out there, just Ж Ж else. "
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record Ж the most Ryder Cup Ж played Ж Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though Ж said his presence Ж Ж intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, likes to poke Ж at people, and he's a great Ж to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players Ж fun having a go at him Ж Ж well, this week Ж which was fun to see.
He provides a lot more than just play. "
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows Ж lead can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain Ж knows from experience that a sizeable lead heading into Ж last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can Ж turn Ж an uncomfortable ride Ж
The Ж made his debut in Ж 1997 Ж at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ж held a five-point Ж over the Americans but only just got over the finishing line with their noses in front by the narrowest of margins, winning 14 ½ -13 ½.
"You keep Ж yourself that we had a big lead at Ж Ж we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost Ж and at Valderrama Ж where we won Ж but only just," said Bjorn, Ж, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 Ж on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will Ж me and everybody on Ж team that this is not over.
You go full bore tomorrow.
Ж Ж there and do all the right things.
This is not over till you've got the points on Ж board.
We have a goal, and that is to try Ж win this Ж, and that's where the focus stays.
I've said all Ж, I focus on the 12 players that are in our Ж, but we are so well Ж of what's standing across on the other side - the greatest players in the world. "
Delighted how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get Ж of myself in this Ж
Tomorrow's Ж different beast.
Tomorrow is the individual performances Ж Ж forward, and that is a different thing to Ж.
It Ж great to be out there with a partner when things are going Ж, but when you're out there individually, then you're tested to the Ж of your capacity as a Ж.
That's the message that you need to get across Ж players Ж is Ж the best out Ж yourself tomorrow.
Now, you leave your Ж behind Ж he has to go Ж get the best out Ж himself, as well. "
In contrast to Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furyk will Ж looking for his players Ж Ж better individually than they did as partners, Ж exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up Ж points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both ends of those big Ж turnarounds Ж having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up a loser as Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."
"I remember every damn word of it Ж" Ж said in reply Ж being asked how Ben Crenshaw Ж the captain in 1999 Ж had Ж his players heading into the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get off to that fast start like you saw at Ж Ж like you saw at Medinah.
When that momentum gets going one way, it puts a lot of pressure Ж those middle matches.
We set up our line-up accordingly and put the guys out in the fashion that we felt like, you know, Ж're trying to make some magic tomorrow. "
Thomas has been handed the task of trying to lead the fightback Ж faces Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through Ж" said Bjorn of his singles selections.
Germany's new Ж postponed yet again
German Ж's newest frigate should have Ж commissioned Ж 2014 to replace ageing Cold War-era warships, but it won't be there until at least the next year due to faulty Ж and Ж cost, local media reported.
Commissioning of the "Ж Ж Ж Ж lead ship of the Ж new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, Ж now been postponed until the first half of Ж, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The vessel Ж have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues plagued the fate of the ambitious Ж Ж
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels the Navy ordered back in Ж will come as replacement to the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood they will feature a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, Ж and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
Ж Ж continuous delays mean that the cutting-edge warships - said to allow Germany to project power overseas - will already become Ж by the time they enter service, Die Zeit Ж.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially Ж to commission the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Ж shipyard in Hamburg Ж
Ж was Ж first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after Ж.
Little was known about the Ж behind the Ж Ж but German media cited a number of crucial "software and Ж defects" that made Ж warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - just half of the manpower on older Ж class frigates.
Ж, Ж emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces Ж performance and limits the Navy Ж ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans in the Second World War Ж
Aside from faulty Ж, the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also becoming an issue.
It Ж said to have reached staggering €3.1billion ($3.6bn) - Ж from initial Ж 2.2 billion.
Problems gripping the newest frigates become especially of importance in light of recent warnings that Ж's naval power Ж shrinking.
Earlier this year, Ж Bartels, chief Ж the German parliament Ж defense committee, Ж the Navy is actually "running out Ж deployment-capable ships Ж"
The official said the issue has snowballed over time, because old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of the of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
National Trust eavesdrops on secret life of bats
New research being carried out at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped the findings will shed new light on the behaviour Ж the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation Ж.
The study by scientists at the National Trust Ж Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations Ж the property to track bat activities throughout the season Ж
NHS Ж and volunteers will also Ж out mobile surveys Ж hand-held Ж.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of the bat calls and which species are doing what.
A Ж map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most Ж to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help Ж the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow creation and how best to maintain woodlands for Ж and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century.
They are under threat from building and development work Ж affects roosts and loss of habitat Ж
Wind turbines and lighting Ж also pose Ж risk, as can flypapers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as Ж as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits their ears are more Ж than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated Ж technique to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in their Ж path Ж
The NTS, which is responsible for the care Ж more than 270 historical buildings, Ж Ж gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around Ж country, takes bats very Ж.
Ж has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, roost inspections and sometimes rescues Ж
The organisation has even set Ж Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estate Ж Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Ж's ten bat species.
Estate Ж David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for Ж.
"Here at Threave we have a great area for bats, Ж Ж said.
"We Ж got Ж old buildings, lots of veteran Ж and all the good habitat.
But there Ж much about bats Ж is still unknown, so the work we do here and at Ж properties will help us understand more about what they Ж to thrive. "
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying Ж maintenance within properties as it is possible unwitting destruction of a single maternity roost could kill Ж to 400 females and young, possibly wiping out an entire local population.
Bats Ж protected and it is illegal to kill, Ж or disturb them or destroy their roosts.
Elisabeth Ж, Scottish officer for the Ж Conservation Ж, has encouraged the public to pitch in to help.
She Ж: "We Ж have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their populations Ж faring."
Ronaldo dismisses rape claims Ж lawyers set to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ж has branded rape claims against Ж Ж "Ж news," saying that people "want to promote themselves Ж by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, Ж published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of Ж an American woman Ж named as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Ж is alleged to have then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Ж.
Speaking in Ж Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, slammed Ж reports Ж "fake news."
"No Ж no Ж no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, "the five-time Ballon d'Or winner says into the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's Ж.
They want to Ж famous to say my name, but it is part of the job.
I am a happy man and Ж good Ж "the player added, smiling.
Ж's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions Ж the area of privacy," according Ж Ж.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an Ж corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is Ж one of the most Ж violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Ж in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went Ж to the player's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to papers filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he Ж "99 percent" a "good guy" let down by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the pair had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police Ж had photographs taken of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified Ж retaliation" and was worried about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now Ж to overturn the settlement as she continues Ж be traumatized by Ж alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on Ж verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester Ж at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer moved to Italian Ж Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' losing carmakers
Ж UK "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as Ж world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Ж Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added it was Ж concerning "that Toyota UK had told Ж BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal Ж would temporarily Ж production at its factory in Burnaston, Ж Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr Ж said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost Ж.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest Ж Ж European Union Ж
"My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Ж UK car manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how Ж trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says Ж will Ж its Mini plant in Oxford for a Ж following Ж.
The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain Ж in the event of a Ж Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every Ж minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without Ж deal on 29 March, there Ж be disruption at Ж border which Ж industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the Ж said, and so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated Ж avoid those checks at the border."
"Ж need to have a Ж. We want to have the best deal that will allow as I say not just the success at present to be enjoyed Ж for us to grasp this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence from not just Toyota Ж other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what Ж been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long production Ж be stopped, but in the Ж Ж, warned that Ж costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, Ж has worked at Ж Ж 24 years and Ж the Unite union convenor at Ж plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: Ж In my experience once these jobs go they never Ж back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for Ж future relationship Ж the EU."
Trump Ж with Rosenstein may be Ж again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "pushed back another week" as the Ж over supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House Ж on Ж.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference Ж links between Trump aides Ж Russia and potential Ж of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will Ж the deputy attorney general, and thereby endanger Mueller's Ж, has fuelled Washington Ж for months.
Earlier this month, Ж New York Times reported Ж Ж discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to Ж White House, amid reports he was Ж to resign.
Instead, Ж meeting with Ж, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was Ж for Thursday.
Ж said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid Ж clash with the Senate judiciary committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who Ж accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered Ж one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Ж about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for Ж hasn't been set, it Ж be this week, I could see Ж pushing back another Ж given all Ж the other things that are going on with Ж supreme court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press updated. "
Ж reporters would contest that assertion Ж Sanders Ж not held a White House press briefing Ж 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of briefings was not due to a distaste for TV reporters "grandstanding," although she said: "I won't disagree with the Ж that they grandstand. Ж
She then Ж direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president does more Ж & A sessions than any president has prior to him Ж" she said, adding without citing evidence: "Ж've looked at Ж Ж."
Briefings will still happen, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the president of Ж United States questions directly, that's infinitely better than talking Ж me.
We try to do that a Ж and you've seen us do that a lot over the last few weeks and that Ж going to take the place of a press briefing when Ж can Ж to the president of the United States. "
Ж Ж takes questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions Ж Ж conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In Ж York this week the president perhaps demonstrated why Ж making a Ж Ж at times bizarre appearance before gathered reporters.
Health secretary Ж to EU workers at Ж Scotland over Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has Ж to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish for them Ж stay on post-Brexit Ж
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months to Ж until the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to meet the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote Ж "Over Ж summer, negotiations between the UK and Ж on withdrawal Ж continued, heading towards expected decisions this autumn Ж
But the UK Government has also been stepping Ж its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.

Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers Ж be charged Ж stamp duty when they buy a property in Ж UK with the extra cash used to help the Ж under new Ж plans
The move will neutralise the success of Corbyn's drive to Ж young voters
The stamp duty Ж will be levied on those who are not paying tax Ж the UK
The Treasury Ж it raise up to £120 million a year- to help the homeless
Foreign buyers are set Ж be charged a higher stamp duty rate when Ж buy property in the UK - with the extra cash Ж to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be Ж as Ж attempt to Ж Ж success of Jeremy Corbyn Ж drive to attract Ж voters with pledges to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The stamp duty rise Ж be levied on individuals and firms not paying tax in Ж UK Ж with Ж extra money boosting the Government's drive to combat rough sleeping.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the present stamp duty Ж including the higher levels introduced Ж years ago on second homes and Ж Ж could be as much as three per cent.
The Ж expects the move to raise Ж to £120 million a Ж.
An estimated 13 per cent of new-build London Ж are bought by Ж residents, driving Ж prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing ladder.
Many wealthy Ж of the country - particularly in the capital Ж have become "Ж towns" Ж of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country Ж
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp Ж cut Ж help more young people own their first home.
He Ж big Ж firms Ж keeping property prices high by Ж up land but not using it Ж and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's "Ж disgrace."
Mr Corbyn Ж announced an eye-catching series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an Ж to "no-fault" evictions.
Ж also wants to give councils greater powers to Ж new homes.
Mrs May said: "Ж year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always Ж open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies Ж to buy homes Ж hard-working British residents.
For Ж many Ж the dream of home ownership has become all too distant, and the indignity of rough sleeping remains Ж Ж real Ж "
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Ж
Sunderland Ж Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become Ж Scotland manager at some stage.
Ж Scot Ж 42 Ж is relishing the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who Ж sit third place in Ж One, three Ж Ж the top.
Ж moved Ж the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I Ж to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and Ж was it, "Ross told BBC Scotland's Ж.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden a lot with my dad as a kid, and it is always something that has drawn me back.
That opportunity Ж only come Ж though, if I am successful Ж club management. "
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Ж Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Ж Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss Ж he felt no trepidation Ж Ж such established Ж at such a big club, having previously rejected overtures from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Ж Success for me at the moment will be gauged Ж 'can I return Ж club to the Premier League?'
Because Ж the structure Ж facilities at Ж Ж, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League, Ж he said.
"It is Ж an easy task to get it Ж, Ж I would probably Ж view myself as being successful here Ж Ж can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years into his management Ж, Ж a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and transformed St Mirren from the brink of relegation to Championship Ж winners Ж following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did Ж his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool Ж Ж, St Mirren and Ж Academical.
Ж It was probably a real crossroads, "he recalled, of taking charge of Alloa.
"I Ж did Ж management Ж the right fit for me, more so than playing.
It sounds bizarre because Ж did okay, Ж a reasonable living out of it, and enjoyed some reasonable highs.
But playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to get Ж on a weekly basis.
I still go through that Ж terms of the stresses Ж pressure of the job but management just feels right.
I Ж wanted to manage and now I am Ж it, it feels the most comfortable Ж Ж been in Ж own skin throughout my entire adult Ж. "

Perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday, survey finds
The summer heatwave has boosted takings for Britain's Ж pubs but heaped Ж pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise Ж per cent in July - but takings in restaurants were down 4.8 per Ж, figures revealed Ж
Peter Martin, of business consultancy CGA Ж which compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar pattern to the previous month Ж June, Ж pubs were up 2.8 per Ж, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trading in June just got worse in July.
Drink-led pubs and bars performed by far the strongest with Ж up more than restaurants were Ж.
Food-led pubs also suffered in the sun Ж Ж not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a Ж.
Across managed Ж and Ж drink sales were up 6.6 Ж cent for Ж month, Ж food down three per cent. "
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social Ж Ж events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It comes as no surprise that Ж groups Ж to struggle, Ж a sales drop of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost Ж.
The long hot Ж could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and time will tell whether the more moderate Ж we've experienced in August will provide some much-needed respite. "
Total sales growth across pub Ж restaurants, including Ж openings, was 2.7 Ж cent in July, reflecting the Ж down in brand Ж.
The Coffer Peach Ж industry sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from Ж operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the established industry benchmark.

Breast pump advert comparing mothers to cows divides opinion online
A breast pump company has divided opinion online with an advert that compares Ж mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of Ж is said to Ж the "world's first silent wearable breast bump Ж" consumer tech company Elvie released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired advert to showcase the freedom the new pump gives to Ж mothers Ж
Four real mothers Ж in a hay-filled barn of cows to Ж track that includes Ж like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see Ж tail" and "In case Ж hadn't noticed these are not udders, they're Ж boobs."
The chorus Ж: "Pump it out, pump it out Ж I'm feeding them babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my ladies."
However, the advert, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views Ж hundreds Ж comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it makes light Ж the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision using cows to advertise Ж Ж.
Like us they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except their babies are stolen from them within days of giving Ж Ж Ж one wrote.
The Ж breast pump fits discreetly inside a nursing bra (Elvie / Mother Ж
Another commented: Ж Understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yeah why not use them Ж advertise a breast pump for mothers who get Ж keep Ж Ж? "
Someone else added: "Ж an out of Ж advert."
Others defended the advert Ж with one woman admitting Ж she found the song "hilarious."
"I think this is a genus idea.
I would've Ж one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advert is a little mad but I took it for what it was.
This is a genius product, "one wrote Ж
Another commented: "Ж is a fun advert aimed at mums who pump (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like" cows. "
This is not an advert praising or judging the dairy industry. "
At the end of the video the group of women reveal they've all been dancing with the discreet pumps tucked in their bras.
Ж concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who breast-pump say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Ж however, is completely silent, Ж no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, Ж their babies, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: Ж The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between expressing women and Ж cows we wanted to Ж breast pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, while Ж in an entertaining and relatable way the incredible sense Ж freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk Ж designer Marta Jakubowski while Ж the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has spiked even though monthly border crossings Ж remained relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been Ж immigrants themselves, and have feared jeopardizing their own ability to remain Ж the country Ж stepping forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal Ж announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data Ж be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration Ж Customs Enforcement, Ж before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later Ж Ж 70 percent of those arrested Ж not have prior criminal records.
"Close to 80 percent of the individuals that are Ж sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and a large chunk of those are Ж Ж.
So we are continuing to Ж those individuals, "Ж Albence said.
Ж to process the children more quickly, Ж introduced new rules that will require some of them to Ж in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers Ж
Ж will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for Ж status to an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed ineligible for relief will be swiftly deported.
The longer that children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter Ж and reports that Ж emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates said those concerns are heightened at a larger Ж Ж Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked, Ж of its size.
Ж added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could compound trauma that many Ж already struggling with.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish Ж Ж forces Ж to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian Ж to come home, even though the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Ж prime minister, said the Ж forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the Ж of fighting terrorism, and "will be Ж with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Ж.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Ж, where Ж than 360,000 Ж have died since 2011 Ж with millions more uprooted from Ж Ж.
He said Damascus would continue "fighting this sacred Ж until we purge all Syrian territories" of both terror groups and "any illegal foreign presence Ж Ж
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Ж Arabs opposed to Ж Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-wracked country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem Ж the conditions were fine for them to return, and he Ж Ж some western countries "for" Ж irrational fears Ж that prompted refugees to stay away Ж
Ж We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns, "he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United Ж and the European Union have Ж that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to Ж the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Ж to Ж up a buffer zone in the Ж major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to press ahead with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal averted a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where Ж million people Ж.
Moualem however stressed that Ж Ж Ж "clear deadlines" Ж expressed hope that military action will target jihadists including fighters from the Ж Nusra Front, Ж "will be eradicated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee comprised of government and opposition Ж to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way to elections.
Moualem laid out conditions for the Ж government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be restricted "to reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.
Why Trump Ж Win a Ж Term

As of now, there are Ж signs of viewer fatigue.

Outside money floods into tightest midterm election House races
Ж's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing a flood of cash, thanks to a Ж Ж a congressional Ж that landed two incumbents in a Ж for the same seat.
This recently redrawn suburban Pittsburg district pits Democrat Ж Conor Ж - who won his seat in another Ж Ж Ж special election last spring Ж
Lamb is running Ж another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th Ж
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally gerrymandered in Republicans' favor.
The race in the new Ж has touched Ж a campaign finance slugfest between the Ж Ж finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow win in a widely watched in March special election for Pennsylvania's Ж Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Ж won the district by 20 Ж.
Political pundits Ж given Democrats a slight edge.
U.S. Weighed Penalizing El Salvador Over Support for Ж, Then Backed Off
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic Ж Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little Ж from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had Ж hotel in Panama until partners evicted Ж Ж Organization's Ж team.
State Ж officials decided Ж call Ж the Ж chiefs of diplomatic Ж Ж El Ж, the Dominican Republic and Ж over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan Ж" Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement early this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 Ж in American aid in 2017, including Ж Ж controls, development and economic Ж Ж
The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Ж American country Ж its high Ж and murder Ж.
As internal meetings progressed Ж North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up Ж similar gathering last year that Ж seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent Ж from heading to the United States.
Ж by mid-September, top administration officials made clear that they wanted the Ж to go forward Ж effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador Ж
Vice President Mike Pence is now slated Ж address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a signal of the import the administration places on the gathering, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new Ж messages or punishments from Washington.
A White Ж spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to Ж on the Ж Ж the debate that were Ж Ж Ж three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the Ж deliberations on the Ж of anonymity.

Ж History
The next shoe to drop could be the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there now is very substantial evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly also turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Ж in its attack on our elections.
Ж Congress change hands, Mr. Ж will Ж himself facing accountability in that body Ж Ж as he prepares to go again before the voters, Ж perhaps eventually a Ж of his peers.
That is a lot of ifs, and I do not mean to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalents Ж Europe.
There are Ж Ж be made by all Ж Ж on both sides of the Ж that will affect how prolonged Ж struggle Ж be.
Ж 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d "état against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and backed the Czechoslovaks at Munich Ж
Ж failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that ensued.
The course of history pivots around such inflection points, and democracy's inexorable march is accelerated or delayed.
Americans face several of these inflection Ж now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump Ж Ж Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the Ж of Mr. Mueller's investigation Ж
Rosenstein has been Ж hot water ever since this paper Ж that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his being unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times's account is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation Ж Brett Kavanaugh is not full or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
Ж above all, will we vote in the midterms for Ж Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will be in for a long winter.
But I believe we Ж not fail Ж because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that Ж occupied my ambassadorial home.
She Ж, immigrated to America and, Ж Ж later, sent me off to Ж Sabbath candles on that table bearing the swastika.
With that as my heritage, how can Ж not be an optimist about our future? "

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Ж Vienna Ж
Rangers Ж Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory Ж the Austrians, Ж the impressive draw in Spain against Ж earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use Ж result as a springboard to greater things.
"It was a good point Ж us because Villarreal are a good side," Ж the 31-year-old.

Ж prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York Ж terror attack that killed eight people Ж a rare Ж that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal Ж since Ж.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck Ж Ж out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Ж Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclist in his path on Oct.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to Ж Ж Saipov "intentionally Ж killed Ж eight victims and" intentionally "Ж serious bodily Ж, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed Ж the Southern District of Ж York.

President Ж Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence she did not Ж the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court Ж Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.

Sanford took the stand Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when Ж said he Ж in Sanford's truck Ж night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."

I Ж he viewed Ж's success sort of in that way.
Although Ж was his creation and his imagination, he always used to give Ж credit to Paddington himself. "

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI begins investigation
"I thought, if we could actually get something like what he was asking for - an investigation limited in Ж, limited in scope - we could maybe Ж a little unity," Ж Mr Flake on Ж, adding Ж he feared the committee was "falling apart" amid Ж Ж gridlock.
Why didn't Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want Ж FBI Ж investigate Ж
Their reluctance is all Ж to timing.
Ж midterm elections are only five weeks Ж, on Ж Ж - if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they Ж elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Ж has been picking up the Ж to call Senators, lobbying them to support Ж Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and through Ж met his wife Ashley Ж who was Mr Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI Ж its report?
Ж will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It's still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get Ж at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice Ж Ж to break a tie and Ж Ж Ж the Supreme Court Ж
North Korea defector numbers Ж drop 'under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Ж has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said Ж
Park Byeong-seug, citing Ж from the Ж's unification ministry, said there had Ж 1,127 defections Ж year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border Ж between North Korea and Ж and higher rates charged by people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has made Ж public comments.
The Ж majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says Ж than 30,000 North Koreans have Ж crossed the border since the end of the Korean Ж in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea Ж is easier to cross than the Ж Ж Ж Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China Ж the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the Ж and the South - who are still technically at war Ж have markedly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Ж met in Pyongyang for talks that centred on the stalled denuclearisation negotiations.
This came after June's historic meeting between Ж President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore Ж when they agreed in Ж terms to work towards the nuclear-free Ж peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed Ж sanctions for the lack of progress since Ж.
"Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national Ж and under such Ж, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr Ri said in a speech Ж the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," says he is unfit to Ж on the Ж Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "Ж" and Ж that he was Ж unfit to serve on the Supreme Ж.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Ж Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't Ж but think that if a woman had ever performed that way, they would say 'Ж Ж'" Pelosi said about her Ж to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Ж Ж Committee Ж Thursday.
Ж emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford Ж they were both teenagers.
Ж his opening statement, Kavanaugh was Ж emotional, at times nearly shouting and choking up while discussing his family and his high school Ж.
He also explicitly Ж Democrats on the Ж, calling the Ж against him a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals Ж that Hillary Clinton lost the Ж presidential election Ж
Pelosi said Ж Ж believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on Ж Supreme Ж, because it showed that Ж is biased against Democrats.
"I think that he Ж himself with those statements and the manner in Ж he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi demurred when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if Democrats gain the majority in the Ж of Representatives.
"Ж will say this -- if he is not telling the truth to Ж or to the FBI, then he's not fit not Ж to be on the Supreme Court, but Ж Ж on Ж court he's on right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court Ж Appeals Ж
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against Ж Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade Ж as he is considered to be a Ж justice.
In his confirmation hearings Ж Kavanaugh sidestepped questions on whether Ж would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's Ж time for a hysterical Ж biased person to go to the court and expect us to say, 'isn't that wonderful,'" Ж said Ж
And Women Need Ж Wield It.
It is a righteous diatribe, months and years of fury spilling over Ж and she can't get it Ж without weeping.
"Ж cry Ж we get angry," Ms. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's uncommon, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive someplace, who Ж she Ж cried when she got angry, but Ж a technique which meant Ж when she got angry and started to cry, she'd say to the person she was talking to," You may think I am sad because I am crying.
Ж am angry. "
Ж then she just kept Ж Ж
And I thought Ж was brilliant. "
Tears are permitted Ж an outlet for wrath Ж Ж Ж Ж are fundamentally misunderstood.
Ж of my sharpest memories from an Ж job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself weeping with inexpressible rage, was my being grabbed Ж the scruff of Ж neck by an older woman Ж a chilly manager of whom I'd always been slightly terrified - who Ж me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you crying," she told me Ж
"They don't know you Ж furious Ж
They think you're sad and will be pleased because they got Ж Ж. "
Patricia Schroeder, then Ж Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential runs.
In Ж, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Ж and bowed out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply Ж, figured Ж was no reason Ж shouldn't explore the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision Ж" Ж said to me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and Ж last thing they needed Ж Ж Ж.
Somebody called it Ж Snow Ж and the Ж Dwarfs. Ж "
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind on fund-raising, Ж so she vowed that she wouldn't enter the race unless she Ж $2 million.
It was a Ж battle Ж
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would give her only $250.
"Ж they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she Ж her speech announcing Ж she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so Ж by emotions - gratitude for the people who'd supported her, Ж with the system that made it so difficult to raise Ж and to target voters rather than delegates Ж Ж anger Ж the sexism - that she got choked up.
"You would Ж thought I'd had a nervous breakdown Ж" recalled Ms. Schroeder Ж how the press reacted to her.
"You Ж have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to Ж on my tombstone?
"She cried"? ""
Ж the US-China trade war may be good for Beijing
Ж opening salvos of Ж trade war between Ж US and China Ж deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries may be Ж to Beijing in the long Ж, Ж say.
Donald Trump, the US President, fired the first Ж earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation Ж in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion Ж worth of items, effectively taxing half Ж all goods coming Ж the US from Ж.
Beijing has retaliated each time in kind, most recently slapping tariffs Ж five to ten per cent on $60 billion of American Ж.
China Ж pledged Ж Ж the US shot-for-shot, and the world Ж second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon.
Ж Washington to back down means caving into demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be far Ж embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Still, experts say if Beijing can Ж its cards right, US trade war pressures could Ж support China over the long term by lowering the inter-dependence of the two economies.
Ж The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could Ж the conditions that Ж an economic tailspin in Ж country is actually Ж lot more dangerous than onlookers have acknowledged Ж, "said Ж Grace, a research associate Ж focuses on Asia at the Center for New Ж Security, a think tank.
